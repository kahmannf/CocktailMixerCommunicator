# CocktailMixerCommunicator

A small API which can be used to send commands through a serial port.

Im trying to build a Cocktailmixer using a Arduino UNO. 
My target is to control this from a computer. Not sure yet whether im going to set up a small website
or use a Desktop-Application to order my drinks.

Check out my Repository <a href="http://www.google.com/">ArduinoCocktailMixerReciever</a> for the code that runs on the Arduino.
